            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p class="description" >Engineers - write more text</p> 

            <p>When I write text I work hard to avoid being too terse.
I've learnt the hard way that for me it's very difficult to write too much.
My natural level is very terse. So what feels like too much to me is often not
nearly enough.</p>
<p>So I try to write more. I write not only about what I'm doing, but why I'm doing
it. I try to explain not only what my changes are, but what existed before, and
what might make sense in future. I try to be explicit about what I know and also
about what I don't know.</p>
<p>I deliberately repeat myself. I intentionally state things again in another way.
That gives people another opportunity to understand what I meant. It can make
the document easier to read.</p>
<p>By providing context for my communications I help people remember what they
already know about my topic. By providing extra information I either inform my
audience, or build their trust by demonstrating shared knowledge. If I tell them
some facts that they know to be true, they're more likely to trust me on the
facts they don't know.</p>
<p>Context helps your audience read your text. Context builds trust. Writing more
text may just help you get to do things you want to do, because people will trust
you to do it.</p>
<p>Write more text.</p>
