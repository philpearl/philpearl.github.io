  <p>We had an outage. Someone deployed a new model, which unfortunately unpacked to use much more memory than the previous version. And we hadn&rsquo;t been monitoring pod memory versus limits properly, and we didn&rsquo;t have checks to see if the new model would fit in available memory before deploying it across our fleet of model runners.</p>

<p>So the model runners all OOM&rsquo;ed and would not restart.</p>

<p>OK, this should be easy. Just increase the memory limits on the model runner and we should be back up quickly. Except we were not back up quickly. The model runner would no longer fit on any of our existing nodes, and for some reason the cluster did not scale up to add more nodes. Why have we run right up against the CPU limit? Because the rest of our system has scaled up to deal with retries. We limit retries and avoid dead instances of services, but with every request retrying just once this is enough to cause everything to scale up. To avoid cascading retries we only retry from the edges of our product, so each retry does quite a lot of work.</p>

<p>This is where we first learnt about the GCP default quota of 600 CPUs per project. GCP won&rsquo;t let us scale up further to clear the problem unless we can increase our quota.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;d been &ldquo;really good&rdquo; with our security. No-one had permissions to request more quota. We can raise our permissions for the gcloud command-line, but quota is only adjustable via the web console. We could update our terraform in git to get the permissions, but that pipeline takes 10 minutes to run, which at this point feels like an eternity.</p>

<p>So, we take down our &ldquo;background&rdquo; model runner (which runs models for testing before they go live) to free up enough memory and CPU to start the main model runner, and we work out the minimum memory we need to get these processes started and request just that amount. And finally they start. One at a time, because they are statefulsets and we have not set &ldquo;xxxx&rdquo;: Parallel. And we can&rsquo;t change that on an existing statefulset.</p>
